# Mobile Browser Comparisons

## Opera:

### Pros:

*	Clean UI, fun and innovative, with pleasing color palette

*	Useful functionalities

    -	“Find in page” functionality allows for easy keywork searching on page
  
    -	“Desktop site” mode
  
    -	Connect to Opera Flow
  
*	Private mode ghost is cute

### Cons:

*	No refresh button in top bar

*	Bubbles overlay over the page content

*	Purple color does not match Opera’s brand of red

    -	Private mode has a magenta theme which should really be flipped

    -	Purple can be the Private theme as it is a darker, more mysterious color

    -	Red evokes courage, passion, and energy, while purple evokes imagination and mystery

*	Purple O logo should be changed back to red for brand recognition

    -	Opera is known for its big red O, and given that it is much less popular than the other big established browsers, it needs that brand recognition to draw in users

    -	Could keep the purple one for Private mode

*	Bottom navigation bubble is difficult to use

    -	Need to hold it down

    -	Too many steps to reach basic functionalities like ‘tab view’ and ‘new tab’

    -	Would be so much easier by just having a bottom navigation bar

        -	This would conform much easier to the user’s mental model of how a mobile browser should work

*	Don’t know how I feel about the background images on the utility pages

*	There is no page elasticity on the “tab” or “search” windows

*	I feel constrained without a URL bar on top of the hub page

*	Way too many automatic actions

    -	Again, feel like I’m being forced to do everything

    -	I don’t feel in control on this app

*	No favorites/bookmarks page!

### Overall Thoughts:

App has a good UI needing slight changes, including branding consistency, but needs a drastic UX overhaul.  Powerful app, but need to put that power in the hands of the user.

### Additional Things to Look Into:

*	Is instant search even necessary or helpful?

*	They added a standard bar you can choose over the fast action button

    -	This still has its own problems, but it should be the default functionality, if not the only one
    
    -	Adding a new tab should not take you out of the experience
    
    -	I feel forced to use the search bar
    
    -	Clearly if the fast action button drove me, an Opera fan, off the app, this is an even larger problem for drawing in foreign users



## Safari:

### Pros:

*	Adding and switching tabs does not take you out of the browsing experience

*	Private tabs setting seems like a second set of tabs instead of an entirely different mode

    -	Again, does not take you out of the browsing experience
    
*	Easy access to bookmarks, history, and favorites

### Cons:

*	Bland UI

*	Settings can’t be accessed in-app

    -	Need to use Settings app

### Overall Thoughts:

A very simple app.  Easy to use, but also nothing too special.



## Firefox:

### Pros:

*	Clean UI

*	Interesting grid-structure tabs page

*	Switching tabs and incognito doesn’t take you out of the experience

*	Settings in-app

*	Can easily get to bookmarks and favorites

*	Choose search engine as you type

### Cons:

*	Pop-up menu in bottom right corner is a bit clunky

### Overall Thoughts:

Clean, intuitive app.  Not as powerful as Opera but adds onto what Safari is lacking.



## Chrome:

### Pros:

*	Very similar in function and features to Firefox

*	Has a “recently closed” tab page in addition to the standard and incognito pages

### Cons:

*	UI elements are a bit bulky

### Overall Thoughts:

Essentially the same app as Firefox, but with a worse UI.



## Edge:

### Pros:

*	Similar to Firefox

*	Drag-up customizable dashboard menu

### Cons:

*	Stiff UI, little elasticity

### Overall Thoughts:

Similar to Firefox with a worse UI, but also has an interesting custom menu feature.



## DuckDuckGo:

### Pros:

*	“Close Tabs & Clear Data” feature

*	All tabs are private

*	Clean UI, mostly nice animations

*	Interesting list tab structure allows for neater viewing of larger amounts of tabs

*	User feels in control

### Cons:

*	“Close Tabs & Clear Data” animation is kind of cheesy

*	Listed tabs don’t show a page preview

### Overall Thoughts:

Simple, intuitive design allows for a fluid private browsing experience.
